# ScoreBoard 
A react application that allows you to view your score based on the game, players, and matches. So, instead of writing in down on a piece of paper to keep track of the score, why not show it on an app for everyone to see!

As a user, you can add a player to a group and see who's first or last place from that group! 

If you are competitive and would like to keep track of scores, this is the application for you!
